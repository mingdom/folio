# Folib Implementation Status Update - May 1, 2025

## Progress on Option Exposure Calculation Issue

### What's Been Done

1. Identified the root cause of the option exposure calculation discrepancy:
   - The issue was in the sign handling for short option positions
   - The old implementation adjusts delta based on position direction in `calculate_black_scholes_delta`
   - The new implementation was not consistently handling this adjustment

2. Implemented a fix by moving the position direction adjustment to the exposure calculation:
   - Modified `calculate_option_exposure` in `src/folib/calculations/exposure.py` to adjust delta based on position direction (quantity)
   - Removed any position direction adjustment from `calculate_option_delta` in `src/folib/calculations/options.py`
   - Updated all relevant function calls to match the new design

3. Verified the fix with the `tests/compare_options.py` script:
   - Created a comprehensive test script that compares both delta and exposure calculations
   - Added caching to avoid repeated API calls to Yahoo Finance
   - Confirmed that individual option exposure calculations now match closely between old and new implementations

### Current Status

While the individual option exposure calculations now match closely, there are still significant differences at the portfolio level:

The most significant differences are in the option exposures:
- Long Option Exposure: +51.8% difference
- Short Option Exposure: -26.9% difference

### Next Steps for Investigation

1. **Portfolio-Level Categorization**: Investigate how options are categorized as "long" or "short" at the portfolio level. The `categorize_option_by_delta` function in `src/folib/calculations/options.py` may be used inconsistently.

2. **Exposure Aggregation**: Review how individual option exposures are aggregated into portfolio-level metrics. The issue might be in how exposures are summed or categorized.

3. **Beta Adjustment**: Check if beta adjustment is applied consistently between the old and new implementations. The differences in beta-adjusted exposures might be amplifying the discrepancies.

4. **Portfolio Processing Logic**: Compare the portfolio processing logic between old and new implementations, particularly in how options are grouped and how their exposures are calculated and aggregated.

5. **Debug with Real Portfolio Data**: Add detailed logging to both implementations to trace how specific options are processed, categorized, and aggregated in the real portfolio data.

### Specific Files to Examine

1. `src/folib/services/portfolio_service.py`: Review the portfolio processing logic, especially in the `create_portfolio_summary` function
2. `src/folio/portfolio_value.py`: Compare with the old implementation's portfolio processing logic
3. `src/folib/calculations/portfolio.py`: Check the exposure aggregation functions
4. `tests/compare_portfolio_implementations.py`: Enhance to provide more detailed diagnostics on specific positions

### Recommended Approach

1. Add detailed logging to both implementations to trace the processing of each option position
2. Create a test script that compares the categorization and exposure calculation for each option position individually
3. Focus on understanding how options are categorized as "long" or "short" in both implementations
4. Once the specific discrepancy is identified, update the relevant functions to match the old implementation's behavior

The fix we implemented for individual option exposures is a step in the right direction, but there are still portfolio-level discrepancies that need to be addressed.
