# Folib Implementation Task Tracker

> 🎯 **Current Focus**: Complete Phase 1 core functionality before moving to integration phases

## 📊 Implementation Progress

| Module | Status | Progress | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| `domain.py` | ✅ DONE | 100% | Core data models implemented |
| `data/*` | ✅ DONE | 100% | Added provider abstraction + caching |
| `calculations/*` | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | 60% | Missing some Greeks calculations |
| `services/*` | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | 40% | Basic structure in place |
| CLI Integration | 🟡 STARTED | 20% | Basic scaffolding only |
| REST API | ❌ NOT STARTED | 0% | Planned for Phase 3 |
| Web UI (React) | ❌ NOT STARTED | 0% | Planned for Phase 3 |

## 🎯 Current Sprint (April 30 - May 14)

### High Priority

## 🚧 Known Issues

1. **Technical Debt**
   - Need to improve test coverage in calculation modules
   - Some functions need input validation
   - Missing type hints in some modules

2. **Blockers**
   - None currently

3. **Dependencies**
   - Option calculations depend on completing Greeks implementation
   - Portfolio simulation depends on PNL calculation completion
