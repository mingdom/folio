# Folib Error Handling Strategy

## Core Philosophy: Fail Fast

For the Folib library, we adopt a minimalist approach to error handling based on the "fail fast" principle. This document outlines our strategy and rationale.

## Key Principles

1. **Minimal Error Handling Code**: We deliberately minimize explicit error handling code in the library.

2. **Leverage Python's Type System**: We rely on Python's type system to catch type-related errors, using type hints extensively.

3. **Transparent Failures**: When errors occur, they should be visible and clear, not hidden or silently handled.

4. **Learn from Real Errors**: Rather than anticipating all possible error scenarios upfront, we prefer to encounter real errors in practice and address them as needed.

## Implementation Guidelines

### What We DO:

- Use descriptive function and parameter names to make usage clear
- Apply comprehensive type hints to catch type errors early
- Use assertions for critical invariants that must be maintained
- Let exceptions propagate to the caller rather than catching and handling them
- Document preconditions in function docstrings

### What We DON'T:

- No generic try/except blocks that mask errors
- No default fallback values that hide problems
- No complex error recovery logic
- No error transformation that obscures the original issue

## Rationale

As a prototype project, our priority is development velocity and code clarity. Extensive error handling adds complexity without proportional value at this stage. By failing fast:

1. We keep the codebase smaller and more maintainable
2. We identify actual error scenarios rather than imagined ones
3. We avoid the complexity of error recovery logic
4. We make debugging easier by seeing errors directly

## Example

```python
# ❌ Avoid this:
def calculate_beta(ticker: str) -> float:
    try:
        # Complex calculation
        return result
    except Exception:
        # Hide the error
        return 1.0  # Default beta

# ✅ Do this instead:
def calculate_beta(ticker: str) -> float:
    # Let errors propagate naturally
    # Complex calculation
    return result
```

## Future Considerations

As the project matures beyond the prototype stage, we may revisit this strategy and introduce more robust error handling where appropriate. This would likely include:

1. Custom exception types for different error categories
2. More granular exception handling
3. Better error messages and recovery strategies

For now, our focus is on building a functional core with clear, simple code that fails transparently when issues arise.
