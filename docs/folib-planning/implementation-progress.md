# Folib Implementation Progress Report

## Current State

The folib implementation has made significant progress, with the following structure in place:

```
src/folib/
├── __init__.py
├── domain.py              # Core data models implemented as planned
├── calculations/          # Pure calculation functions
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── exposure.py       # Exposure calculations
│   └── options.py        # Option pricing and Greeks
├── data/                 # Data access layer
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── cache.py         # Additional caching functionality
│   ├── loader.py        # Portfolio CSV loading
│   ├── provider.py      # Abstract provider interface
│   ├── provider_fmp.py  # Financial Modeling Prep provider
│   ├── provider_yfinance.py # Yahoo Finance provider
│   └── stock.py         # Market data access
├── examples/            # Added component (not in original plan)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── fmp_provider_example.py
│   └── load_portfolio_example.py
└── services/           # Business logic orchestration
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── portfolio_service.py
    └── simulation_service.py
```

## Differences from Original Plan

### Structural Changes

1. **Data Provider Architecture**
   - Added abstraction layer with `provider.py`
   - Multiple provider implementations (YFinance, FMP)
   - Dedicated caching module

2. **Examples Directory**
   - New addition not in original plan
   - Contains usage examples and demos

3. **Domain Model Implementation**
   - Implemented as planned with frozen dataclasses
   - Added additional position types (CashPosition, UnknownPosition)
   - Maintained composition over inheritance

### Feature Implementation Status

✅ Complete
🟡 Partial
❌ Not Started

Core Components:
- ✅ Domain Models (`domain.py`)
- ✅ Data Access Layer (`data/`)
- 🟡 Calculation Functions (`calculations/`)
- 🟡 Service Layer (`services/`)

Integration Points:
- 🟡 CLI Application Integration
- ❌ REST API
- ❌ New Web UI

## Analysis of Differences

### Positive Developments

1. **Enhanced Data Provider Architecture**
   - More flexible and maintainable than original plan
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Easier to add new data sources

2. **Examples Directory**
   - Improves developer experience
   - Serves as living documentation
   - Helps validate the API design

3. **Extended Position Types**
   - Better handles edge cases
   - More robust portfolio parsing
   - Improved error handling

### Areas Needing Attention

1. **Calculation Functions**
   - Some planned functions not yet implemented
   - Need to complete options Greeks calculations
   - Beta calculation needs refinement

2. **Service Layer**
   - Portfolio simulation needs more work
   - PNL analysis partially implemented
   - Missing some planned high-level functions

## Next Steps

### Phase 1 Completion (Current Focus)
1. Complete remaining calculation functions
   - Implement missing options Greeks calculations
   - Finish beta calculation implementation
   - Add volatility calculations

2. Enhance service layer
   - Complete portfolio simulation
   - Implement PNL analysis functions
   - Add portfolio grouping functions

### Phase 2 Planning
1. CLI Integration
   - Design CLI interface
   - Implement command structure
   - Add configuration management

### Phase 3 Preparation
1. API Design
   - Document API requirements
   - Design REST endpoints
   - Plan authentication strategy

2. Web UI Planning
   - Evaluate React framework options
   - Design component architecture
   - Plan migration from Dash

## Recommendations

1. **Short Term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Complete missing calculation functions
   - Add unit tests for existing functionality
   - Document provider interfaces

2. **Medium Term (1-2 months)**
   - Complete CLI integration
   - Add integration tests
   - Create comprehensive examples

3. **Long Term (3+ months)**
   - Begin API development
   - Start web UI migration
   - Implement advanced features

## Conclusion

The implementation has diverged from the original plan in ways that generally improve the architecture. The core domain model and data access layers are solid, while calculation and service layers need more work. The addition of the provider architecture and examples directory are positive developments that should be maintained and expanded.

Progress is good but slightly behind schedule in terms of calculation and service layer completion. The next few weeks should focus on completing these core components before moving to integration phases.
