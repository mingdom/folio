# Ticker Service Implementation Tasks

This document tracks the high-level tasks for implementing the ticker service across multiple phases. It serves as a central reference for tracking progress and planning future work.

## Phase 1: Core Implementation âœ…

The core implementation of the ticker service is complete. We've created the basic infrastructure and updated the CLI and portfolio service to use it.

- [x] Create the `TickerData` class with properties for cash-like instruments
- [x] Implement the basic `TickerService` class with in-memory caching
- [x] Implement time-based cache invalidation
- [x] Update CLI code to use the `TickerService` for beta values
- [x] Update CLI code to use the `TickerService` for prices in all locations
- [x] Update portfolio service to use the `TickerService`
- [x] Add position service functions for accessing ticker data
- [ ] Add unit tests for the `TickerService`

## Phase 2: Data Model Optimization and Cache Integration

This phase focuses on reducing data duplication and improving caching.

### Phase 2.1: Data Model Optimization

- [ ] Identify all places where market data is duplicated
- [ ] Implement property-based access in position objects that call the ticker service
- [ ] Keep core position data in position objects, but make derived data use the ticker service
- [ ] Update all code that directly accesses market data to use the ticker service

### Phase 2.2: Cache Integration

- [ ] Analyze the existing cache decorator pattern
- [ ] Implement a multi-level caching strategy:
  - [ ] Keep a small in-memory cache for frequent lookups
  - [ ] Use the persistent cache decorator for longer-term storage
- [ ] Establish clear boundaries between the two caching layers
- [ ] Implement cache management methods

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

These features have been deferred to a future phase.

### Phase 3.1: Bulk Prefetching

- [ ] Implement methods to analyze portfolios for unique tickers
- [ ] Create batch processing capabilities for API calls
- [ ] Add prefetching triggers in key workflows
- [ ] Test prefetching performance

### Phase 3.2: Testing

- [ ] Create unit tests for all ticker service methods
- [ ] Add integration tests with the portfolio service
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Measure and optimize performance

## Phase 4: Migration and Cleanup

- [ ] Identify all places in the codebase that directly access market data
- [ ] Migrate these to use the `TickerService`
- [ ] Remove any redundant market data handling code
- [ ] Update tests to use the `TickerService`

## Current Status

We have completed Phase 1 and are now planning for Phase 2. The current focus is on:

1. **Data Model Optimization**: Implementing property-based access in position objects that call the ticker service
2. **Cache Integration**: Analyzing how to apply our cache decorator pattern to the ticker service

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing property-based access in position objects
2. Analyze the existing cache decorator pattern and how it can be applied to the ticker service
3. Create a detailed implementation plan for Phase 2.1

## Open Questions

1. Should we completely remove market data from position objects or keep it as a cache?
2. What are the appropriate TTLs for different types of ticker data?
3. How should we handle API rate limiting for bulk operations?
4. Should we implement background refreshing for frequently accessed tickers?

## Success Criteria

1. Reduced data duplication in the codebase
2. Improved cache hit rates
3. Better performance for portfolio processing
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Cleaner, more maintainable code
