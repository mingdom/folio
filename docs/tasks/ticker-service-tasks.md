# Ticker Service Implementation Tasks

This document tracks the high-level tasks for implementing the ticker service across multiple phases. It serves as a central reference for tracking progress and planning future work.

## Phase 1: Core Implementation âœ…

The core implementation of the ticker service is complete. We've created the basic infrastructure and updated the CLI and portfolio service to use it.

- [x] Create the `TickerData` class with properties for cash-like instruments
- [x] Implement the basic `TickerService` class with in-memory caching
- [x] Implement time-based cache invalidation
- [x] Update CLI code to use the `TickerService` for beta values
- [x] Update CLI code to use the `TickerService` for prices in all locations
- [x] Update portfolio service to use the `TickerService`
- [x] Add position service functions for accessing ticker data
- [ ] Add unit tests for the `TickerService`

## Phase 2: Data Model Optimization and Cache Integration

This phase focuses on reducing data duplication and improving caching.

### Phase 2.1: Data Model Optimization

- [x] Identify all places where market data is duplicated
- [x] Refactor the service layer to use the ticker service for all market data
- [x] Keep domain objects pure without direct dependencies on services
- [x] Update all code that directly accesses market data to use the ticker service
- [x] Ensure proper separation of concerns between domain and service layers

### Phase 2.2: Cache Integration

- [x] Analyze the existing cache decorator pattern
- [x] Implement a multi-level caching strategy:
  - [x] Keep a small in-memory cache for frequent lookups
  - [x] Use the persistent cache decorator for longer-term storage
- [x] Establish clear boundaries between the two caching layers
- [x] Implement cache management methods

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

These features have been deferred to a future phase.

### Phase 3.1: Bulk Prefetching

- [ ] Implement methods to analyze portfolios for unique tickers
- [ ] Create batch processing capabilities for API calls
- [ ] Add prefetching triggers in key workflows
- [ ] Test prefetching performance

### Phase 3.2: Testing

- [ ] Create unit tests for all ticker service methods
- [ ] Add integration tests with the portfolio service
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Measure and optimize performance

## Phase 4: Migration and Cleanup (In Progress)

- [x] Identify all places in the codebase that directly access market data
- [x] Add a `get_volatility` method to the ticker service
- [x] Update CLI components to use the ticker service instead of market_data_provider
- [x] Simplify the market data provider to focus solely on fetching data
- [x] Remove the session cache from the market data provider
- [x] Update the position service to use the ticker service for most operations
- [x] Fix the portfolio service to use the correct cache logging function
- [ ] Update tests to use the `TickerService` consistently
- [ ] Fix failing tests related to exposure calculations
- [ ] Ensure all CLI components work correctly with the ticker service
- [ ] Complete comprehensive documentation of the ticker service architecture

## Current Status

We have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2, and we're now working on Phase 4 (Migration and Cleanup). We've decided to skip Phase 3 for now. The current focus is on:

1. **Migration**: Completing the migration of all code to use the ticker service
2. **Testing**: Fixing failing tests and ensuring all components work correctly
3. **Documentation**: Documenting the ticker service architecture and usage patterns

## Next Steps

1. Fix the failing tests related to exposure calculations
2. Complete the migration of any remaining code to use the ticker service
3. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
4. Measure and optimize performance

## Open Questions

1. Should we update the expected values in the critical tests to match the new implementation, or should we adjust the implementation to match the expected values?
2. Should we completely remove the `MarketData` protocol from the position service, or keep it for flexibility?
3. How should we handle the volatility data in the ticker service? Currently, it returns a fixed value of 0.3.
4. Should we add more detailed logging for cache hits and misses to help with performance optimization?
5. How should we handle network errors and timeouts when fetching data?
6. Should we implement a fallback mechanism for when the ticker service fails to fetch data?

## Success Criteria

1. Reduced data duplication in the codebase
2. Improved cache hit rates
3. Better performance for portfolio processing
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Cleaner, more maintainable code
