# Ticker Service Phase 2 Planning

## WHY: User's Goal

Now that we have completed Phase 1 of the ticker service implementation, we need to plan for Phase 2 to further improve the service. The primary goals for Phase 2 are:

1. Optimize data storage by removing duplicated data in our data model
2. Implement persistent caching using our existing cache decorator pattern
3. Add bulk prefetching capabilities to improve performance
4. Create comprehensive tests for the ticker service

## WHAT: Problem Statement

### Data Duplication Analysis

Currently, our data model stores ticker-related information in multiple places:

1. Position objects store ticker symbols, prices, and sometimes beta values
2. The `market_data_provider` has its own in-memory and persistent cache
3. The new `ticker_service` maintains its own in-memory cache

This duplication leads to:
- Inconsistent data when values are updated in one place but not others
- Increased memory usage
- Complex code to keep everything in sync

### Caching Improvements

The current `ticker_service` implementation has basic in-memory caching with time-based invalidation, but it doesn't leverage our existing cache decorator pattern that provides persistent caching. We need to:

1. Analyze how to apply our cache decorator to the ticker service
2. Determine the appropriate cache TTLs for different types of data
3. Implement a strategy for cache invalidation and refreshing

### Prefetching Strategy

For optimal performance, we should prefetch ticker data in bulk rather than fetching it one ticker at a time. This requires:

1. Identifying common patterns of ticker usage
2. Implementing bulk prefetching methods
3. Determining when to trigger prefetching

## HOW: Solution

### 1. Data Model Optimization

We will refactor our data model to reduce duplication:

1. **Position Objects**:
   - Remove redundant market data (like beta values) from position objects
   - Add methods to access this data via the ticker service
   - Update all code that accesses these properties to use the new methods

2. **Centralized Data Access**:
   - Make the ticker service the single source of truth for all ticker-related data
   - Update all code that directly accesses market data to use the ticker service

### 2. Cache Integration

We will integrate our existing cache decorator pattern with the ticker service:

1. **Apply Cache Decorators**:
   - Add cache decorators to key methods in the ticker service
   - Use appropriate TTLs for different types of data

2. **Cache Management**:
   - Implement methods to clear and refresh the cache
   - Add cache statistics reporting

### 3. Bulk Prefetching Implementation

We will implement bulk prefetching capabilities:

1. **Portfolio Analysis**:
   - Analyze a portfolio to identify all unique tickers
   - Prefetch data for all tickers in a single operation

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Implement batch processing for API calls
   - Handle rate limiting and errors gracefully

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

We will create comprehensive tests for the ticker service:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual methods with mock data
   - Test edge cases like cash positions and missing data

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the ticker service with the portfolio service
   - Test cache behavior and invalidation

## Scope

This proposal affects:
- How position objects access market data
- The caching strategy for ticker data
- Performance optimization for portfolio processing
- Test coverage for the ticker service

## Assumptions

- The existing cache decorator pattern can be applied to the ticker service
- Position objects will be updated to use the ticker service for market data
- We can batch API calls for better performance
- The existing tests can be adapted to work with the new approach

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 2.1: Data Model Optimization

1. Identify all places where market data is duplicated
2. Implement property-based access in position objects that call the ticker service
3. Keep core position data in position objects, but make derived data use the ticker service
4. Update all code that directly accesses market data to use the ticker service

### Phase 2.2: Cache Integration

1. Analyze the existing cache decorator pattern
2. Implement a multi-level caching strategy:
   - Keep a small in-memory cache for frequent lookups
   - Use the persistent cache decorator for longer-term storage
3. Establish clear boundaries between the two caching layers
4. Implement cache management methods

### Future Phases (Deferred)

#### Phase 3.1: Bulk Prefetching

1. Implement methods to analyze portfolios for unique tickers
2. Create batch processing capabilities for API calls
3. Add prefetching triggers in key workflows
4. Test prefetching performance

#### Phase 3.2: Testing

1. Create unit tests for all ticker service methods
2. Add integration tests with the portfolio service
3. Test edge cases and error handling
4. Measure and optimize performance

## Additional Assumptions

1. **Position Data Model**:
   - Core position data (ticker, quantity, price, etc.) will remain in position objects
   - Derived data (beta, exposures) will be accessed via properties that call the ticker service
   - This maintains clean separation while keeping essential data close to where it's used

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - We'll implement a multi-level caching approach with both in-memory and persistent caches
   - The persistent cache will be the source of truth, with the in-memory cache as a performance optimization
   - Clear cache invalidation policies will be established for both layers

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - We'll test the implementation manually through the CLI before adding automated tests
   - This allows for adjustments based on real-world usage before locking down the implementation

4. **Incremental Approach**:
   - We'll implement and test the data model optimization and cache integration first
   - Prefetching and comprehensive testing will be deferred to a later phase

## Open Questions

1. Should we completely remove market data from position objects or keep it as a cache?
2. What are the appropriate TTLs for different types of ticker data?
3. How should we handle API rate limiting for bulk operations?
4. Should we implement background refreshing for frequently accessed tickers?

## Success Criteria

1. Reduced data duplication in the codebase
2. Improved cache hit rates
3. Better performance for portfolio processing
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed tasks for each phase
2. Prioritize tasks based on impact and dependencies
3. Implement and test each phase incrementally
4. Document the new approach for other developers
