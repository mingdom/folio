# Project Rules
- Maintain strict separation of concerns: Business logic MUST reside in the core library (`src/folio/`), not in interface layers in either `src/cli/` or `src/folio`.
- Use `.refs/` to write plans out in markdown format
- All application, test and lint logs are in `logs/`
- `@docs` has project docs, including `@project-design.md`

# Prohibited actions - **NEVER** run these:
- Do not run `make folio`. You can't test your code changes by running the application.

# Encouraged Actions
- `make lint`: Run this all the time to catch lint issues early
- `make test`: Unit tests
