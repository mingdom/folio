# User Interaction Rules
- Unless asked by the user, you should NOT write code. See the "When to NOT edit code" section below.
- When the user says "STOP" - stop editing immediately and give the user a summary of your progress.

# When to STOP and ask the user
STOP and ASK for help if:
- If you are making repeated edits to the same file without resolving the issue
- If you exceed 3 tries at any task
