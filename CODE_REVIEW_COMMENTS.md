## Code Review Comments for PR: Refactor: Improve Options Calculations and CLI Display

Overall, this is a comprehensive and much-needed refactoring of the options calculation engine and CLI display. The effort to handle numerous edge cases, especially for options pricing, is commendable. The introduction of `calculation_date` throughout the system is a significant improvement for consistency and testability.

Below are specific comments by file, focusing on areas that may require further attention or clarification, particularly regarding consistency with design principles and potential impacts on accuracy.

---

**General Comments:**

*   **Design Consistency**: There are a few instances where the implementation appears to deviate from the "fail-fast" and "propagate exceptions" principles outlined in the `options-calculation-improvements.md` design document. It would be beneficial to clarify if these deviations are intentional and why, or if they should be revisited.
*   **Complexity vs. Robustness**: The handling of options calculations has become more complex. While this aims for robustness, ensure that the logic remains maintainable and that the test suite adequately covers this increased complexity.

**`src/cli/formatters.py`:**

*   **Portfolio Summary - "Net Exposure %"**:
    *   The `net_exposure_pct` field was removed from the `PortfolioSummary` object. Please verify that the new display logic for "Net Exposure %" in the summary table (presumably `percent(net_market_exposure)`) correctly reflects the intended value.
*   **Exposures Table - Display Logic**:
    *   The logic in `create_exposures_table` for generating rows and calculating percentages (both "% of Portfolio" and "Beta Adjusted %") appears quite intricate.
        *   Could you double-check that all intended exposure types from the `exposures` dictionary are being displayed? The current structure seems to prioritize a fixed list of rows ("Long Stock", "Short Stock", etc.).
        *   There's a `percentage` variable calculated in the outer loop that doesn't seem to be used for the rows added to the table. Is this dead code, or is there a misunderstanding in my reading?
        *   Please confirm that the correct percentage values are being aligned with the correct column headers for all displayed rows.

**`src/folib/calculations/options.py`:**

*   **Fail-Fast Principle vs. Fallbacks**:
    *   The `options-calculation-improvements.md` document emphasizes a strict "fail-fast" approach. However, in `calculate_implied_volatility`, there are scenarios (e.g., mispricing at expiry, IV calculation failure for near-expiry options) where the function logs a warning and returns `DEFAULT_VOLATILITY` (0.3) or `MIN_VOLATILITY_TO_CALCULATE_DELTA`.
    *   Could you clarify the rationale for these fallbacks? While they allow calculations to proceed, they might mask underlying data issues or lead to less accurate greeks if the default volatility is not representative. Should these cases raise an `OptionCalculationError` instead, to align more closely with the documented design?
*   **Delta Approximation for Low Volatility**:
    *   When volatility is very low (but not zero or meeting deep ITM/OTM criteria), `calculate_option_delta` approximates delta to 0.5 (for calls) or -0.5 (for puts).
    *   What is the potential impact of this approximation on overall exposure calculations? Is this level of precision acceptable, or should it be refined? A brief comment in the code explaining the rationale for this specific approximation could be helpful.
*   **Intrinsic Value Check for Puts at Expiry**:
    *   In `calculate_implied_volatility`, for an expired put option, the logic to handle potential mispricing includes:
        ```python
        # ...
        price_at_expiry = max(0, strike_price - underlying_price) # For Put
        if option_price < price_at_expiry - 0.0001:
            logger.warning(...) # Log mispricing
            return DEFAULT_VOLATILITY
        return 0.0 # If not mispriced (or price > intrinsic)
        ```
    *   For an expired put, the `option_price` should ideally equal its intrinsic value (`max(0, strike_price - underlying_price)`). If `option_price < price_at_expiry`, it indeed suggests an issue (e.g., data error, or the option wasn't exercised when it should have been if held).
    *   The comment `# Put option, check for early exercise` seems confusing here, as the option is already expired.
    *   Returning `DEFAULT_VOLATILITY` in this "mispriced" scenario for an expired option seems counterintuitive, as an expired option should have zero volatility. Its value is fixed. Perhaps raising an error or returning 0 IV (as it does if not "mispriced") would be more appropriate?
*   **Increased Complexity**:
    *   The efforts to handle various edge cases (expiry, near-expiry, low volatility) are noted and appreciated. This has understandably increased the complexity of this module. Robust testing is key here.

**`src/folib/services/position_service.py`:**

*   **Error Handling Deviation (`analyze_option_position`)**:
    *   This function catches `OptionCalculationError` from `options.py` and, instead of propagating the exception, logs an error and sets greeks/exposure values to 0.0 or `None`.
    *   This is a deviation from the "fail fast" and "Exceptions will be propagated to the caller" principles mentioned in the design document for the calculation layer.
    *   While this approach makes the service layer more resilient (one bad option doesn't halt all analysis), it means that errors from the core calculation logic are absorbed and might lead to portfolio-level inaccuracies that are not immediately obvious to upstream callers.
    *   Is this "fail gracefully" behavior at the service level an intentional design choice? If so, it might be worth documenting this decision and its implications.
*   **Beta Value Dependency**:
    *   The calculations for `beta_adjusted_market_value` (for stocks) and `beta_adjusted_exposure_value` (for options) now depend on `market_data_service.get_stock_beta()`.
    *   The mock ticker service currently defaults to a beta of 1.0 if a specific beta isn't set up. How is this handled in the production `market_data_service` if beta is unavailable for a ticker? Does it raise an error, or return a default? Relying on a default beta of 1.0 could misrepresent risk.

**`tests/assets/test_portfolio.csv`:**

*   **Inconsistent Placeholders**:
    *   For non-option rows, `option_type` uses "NULL", while `strike_price` and `expiration_date` now use "0".
    *   Using "0" as a placeholder for `expiration_date` is particularly concerning as it's not a valid date representation and could lead to parsing errors or be misinterpreted if the column is typed as a date.
    *   It's recommended to standardize these placeholders. Using empty strings (``) or a consistent "NULL" string for all "not applicable" text fields is common for CSVs. For numeric/date fields, they should ideally be empty if nullable, or use a clearly defined sentinel that the parser understands.

---

**`tests/folib/calculations/test_options_calculations.py`:**

*   **Validation of Fallback Logic**:
    *   The tests effectively verify *that* fallbacks to `DEFAULT_VOLATILITY` or approximations occur and that warnings are logged.
    *   It's crucial to also ensure that the *conditions* triggering these fallbacks are correctly implemented and that the *chosen fallback values/approximations themselves* (e.g., `DEFAULT_VOLATILITY = 0.3`, delta = 0.5/-0.5) are financially sound and acceptable for the business context. This might require discussion with domain experts.

---

**`tests/folib/critical/test_portfolio_calculations_optimized.py`:**

*   **Accuracy of Expected Assertion Values**:
    *   This is of utmost importance. These tests validate the end-to-end calculation integrity. The expected values in assertions have changed significantly due to the refactoring.
    *   **These new expected values MUST be independently verified for accuracy.** Any errors in these expected values will lead to tests passing while potentially masking calculation bugs.
*   **Error Handling Test Coverage**:
    *   Please ensure there are explicit test cases that verify the behavior when `analyze_option_position` (in `position_service.py`) encounters and handles an `OptionCalculationError`.
    *   Specifically, these tests should confirm that greeks/exposure for the problematic option are zeroed out (or set to None) and that the overall portfolio calculation proceeds correctly, aggregating values from other, valid positions.

---

**`tests/folib/fixtures/mock_ticker_service.py`:**

*   **Mock Service Fallbacks**:
    *   The `MockMarketDataService.get_stock_beta` defaults to 1.0 if beta for a ticker isn't explicitly mocked.
    *   Similarly, `get_option_market_price` defaults to 1.0 if an option price isn't mocked.
    *   While these fallbacks prevent tests from failing due to incomplete mock setups, they can also lead to tests passing with potentially unrealistic default data, possibly masking issues or reducing the specificity of a test.
    *   Consider if it would be more robust for these mock methods to raise an error if data for a specific ticker/symbol requested by a test isn't explicitly configured. This would make tests fail fast if their setup is incomplete. Alternatively, the current behavior should be clearly documented as acceptable for the testing strategy.
