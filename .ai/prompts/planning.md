# Planning: a thought framework
WHY, WHAT, HOW: Think in this order
1. Start with WHY - capture what you think the user's goal is and repeat it back
2. WHAT: next describe the problmem statement or what we are building concisely
3. HOW: finally, outline the solution. If this is an initial draft, don't spend too much time here

A good plan should also have the following sections:
- Scope: what's the impact of this work? what are all the files or modules affected? is this a trivial or complicated change?
- Assumptions: What assumptions are we making with this plan?
- Open questions or blocking issues: What questions or issues must we resolve before we can have a solid plan to implement?

Once you covered your basis. Write the full plan in `.refs/planning-markdown-docs`.
