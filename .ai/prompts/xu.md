# Xu's Rules
The fewer lines of code, the better. But do not sacrifice readability.
Before we proceed, I need you to give me a summary of the current state. Summarize what we just did, which files were updated, and what didn’t work. Do not include assumptions or theories—only the facts.
You should start the reasoning paragraph with lots of uncertainty and slowly gain confidence as you think about the item more.
Break this large change into the required steps. Only include the truly necessary steps.
Do not write comments that are not necessary and the code easily explains itself.
When updating the tests to pass, never make it pass for the sake of passing. Never hide errors. Tests should fail if there is actual bug in the code.
