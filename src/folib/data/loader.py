CSV portfolio loading functions.

This module provides functions for loading and parsing portfolio CSV files.
It handles the transformation of raw CSV data into structured PortfolioHolding objects
that can be further processed by the portfolio service.

Migration Plan Notes:
---------------------
This module is part of Phase 1 of the folib migration plan, focusing on Portfolio Loading E2E.
It replaces the CSV loading functionality in src/folio/portfolio.py with a cleaner,
more maintainable design that separates data loading from business logic.

CSV Format:
----------
The primary source format is portfolio-private.csv, which contains the following columns:
- Account Number (private, not used)
- Account Name (private, not used)
- Symbol (used: ticker symbol)
- Description (used: text description of the security)
- Quantity (used: number of shares/contracts)
- Last Price (used: current price per share/contract)
- Last Price Change (not used)
- Current Value (used: total value of the position)
- Today's Gain/Loss Dollar (not used)
- Today's Gain/Loss Percent (not used)
- Total Gain/Loss Dollar (not used)
- Total Gain/Loss Percent (not used)
- Percent Of Account (not used)
- Cost Basis Total (used: total cost basis)
- Average Cost Basis (not used)
- Type (not used)

Only the essential columns (Symbol, Description, Quantity, Last Price, Current Value,
Cost Basis Total) are extracted and stored in PortfolioHolding objects to maintain
privacy and focus on the core position data.

Old Codebase References:
------------------------
- src/folio/portfolio.py: Contains the original CSV loading and processing logic
- src/folio/cash_detection.py: Contains logic for detecting cash-like positions
- src/folio/utils.py: Contains utility functions for cleaning currency values

Potential Issues:
----------------
- The old codebase mixed CSV loading with data processing and calculations
- Different brokers may use different CSV formats requiring adaptation
- Some securities may have missing or invalid data in the CSV
- Cash-like positions and pending activity need special detection logic
- Currency values in the CSV may need cleaning (removing '$', ',', etc.)

def load_portfolio_from_csv(file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Load portfolio data from a CSV file.

    This function reads the portfolio CSV file and returns it as a pandas DataFrame.
    It handles basic file I/O errors and ensures the CSV has the expected format.

    The expected CSV format is based on portfolio-private.csv with columns:
    Symbol, Description, Quantity, Last Price, Current Value, Cost Basis Total, etc.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the CSV file

    Returns:
        DataFrame with portfolio data

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the CSV file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If the CSV file is empty or missing required columns

def parse_portfolio_holdings(df: pd.DataFrame) -> list[PortfolioHolding]:
    """
    Parse raw CSV data into portfolio holdings.

    This function transforms the raw DataFrame into a list of PortfolioHolding objects,
    extracting only the essential columns and cleaning the data as needed.

    It handles:
    - Extracting the core fields (Symbol, Description, Quantity, Last Price, Current Value, Cost Basis Total)
    - Cleaning currency values (removing '$', ',', etc.)
    - Converting data types (strings to floats, etc.)
    - Handling missing or invalid values

    Args:
        df: DataFrame with portfolio data from load_portfolio_from_csv()

    Returns:
        List of PortfolioHolding objects containing only the essential position data

    Raises:
        ValueError: If required columns are missing or data conversion fails

def detect_cash_positions(holdings: list[PortfolioHolding]) -> list[PortfolioHolding]:
    """
    Detect cash and cash-like positions in portfolio holdings.

    This function identifies cash and cash-equivalent positions (money market funds,
    short-term treasuries, etc.) from the list of portfolio holdings.

    Cash detection is based on:
    - Symbol patterns (e.g., symbols containing "MM", "CASH", "TREASURY")
    - Description patterns (e.g., descriptions containing "Money Market", "Cash", "Treasury")
    - Low beta and volatility characteristics

    Args:
        holdings: List of portfolio holdings from parse_portfolio_holdings()

    Returns:
        List of holdings that represent cash or cash-like positions
    """
    raise NotImplementedError("Function not yet implemented")


def detect_pending_activity(holdings: list[PortfolioHolding]) -> float:
    """
    Detect and calculate pending activity value.

    This function identifies and calculates the total value of pending activity
    in the portfolio (e.g., unsettled trades, dividends, etc.).

    Pending activity detection is based on:
    - Symbol patterns (e.g., "PENDING", "UNSETTLED")
    - Description patterns (e.g., descriptions containing "Pending", "Unsettled", "Dividend")
    - Special account types or flags in the original CSV

    Args:
        holdings: List of portfolio holdings from parse_portfolio_holdings()

    Returns:
        Total value of pending activity (positive for incoming funds, negative for outgoing)
