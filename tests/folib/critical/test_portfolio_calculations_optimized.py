"""
Critical tests for portfolio calculation functionality (optimized version).

This module contains critical tests for the portfolio calculation functionality,
focusing on ensuring that portfolio values, exposures, and other key metrics
are correctly calculated from portfolio CSV files.

These tests are marked as 'critical' because they verify core functionality
that directly impacts user experience. Failures in these tests indicate
serious issues that must be addressed immediately.

The tests specifically focus on:
1. Correct calculation of portfolio total value
2. Correct calculation of market exposure
3. Correct calculation of beta-adjusted exposure
4. Consistency of calculations across portfolio processing

These tests use a mock ticker service to ensure consistent and deterministic
test results without making any API calls or relying on caches.

Performance optimizations:
- Module-scoped fixtures to avoid redundant setup
- Prefetching of ticker data to reduce redundant service calls
- Optimized consistency test that avoids duplicate portfolio processing
- Reduced logging during test execution
