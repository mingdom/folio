   We use `poetry` under the hood to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   # For macOS/Linux
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

   # For Windows
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -

### Development Workflow

Our project uses Poetry for dependency management and Make for convenient command shortcuts.

1. **Set up pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
